Logic dictates that you carry out your stealthy operation during times of diminished visibility. It would
be prudent to thoroughly scout the location beforehand, but that is not the focus of this chapter. Use common
sense and try to prepare yourself mentally for the arduous task ahead. Keep in mind that you *will* encounter
opposition from the victim, unless she is either morbidly obese, or a nymphomaniac. However, the majority of
your targets will not fall within these two groupings, as you should avoid the former and will almost never
stumble upon the latter. Try to time your activities so they coincide with that narrow timeframe of true
twilight where human vision is heavily hampered by the transition from light to dark. If that isn't
possible, then be cognizant of the fact that your chances of being discovered grow exponentially
with the amount of illumination bathing your surroundings. This, of course, can be circumvented
by preying on lonely women in isolated locations.

Another important part of this section is to convey the mechanisms of overpowering the target. There are not
enough words to capitalize the importance of using excessive restraining measures against the victim. Always
use more force than you may think is necessary while taking care not to overdo it. This is vital because when in
such circumstances the victim's body becomes flooded with adrenaline which makes them significantly more resistant to
pain and much less susceptible to psychological trauma.

Do not hesitate to use your fists. A quick slap, or a punch is usually a very effective way to immobilize
the victim for a period between one and five minutes, but take care and exercise caution as to the amount of force
you plan to exert, unless you plan to kill her before starting the natural coitus. Escessive use of punishing 
trauma can visibly disfigure your victim, thus significantly lessening the amount of pleasure you'll derive later 
from your planned activities. However a "perk" of killing her is that she will not need any restraints and getting 
into position is a much easier thing to do. From my own adventures of exploring natural coitus, killing the target
can be highly enjoyable if you can manage to do it cleanly. The body is still warm for a few hours, which is perfect 
for when coitus really gets into its most intense times.



It's also highly reccomended that you use handcuffs against the victim, because it's a relatively efficient,
quick, and easy way to restrain someone while at the same time inducing the maximum amount of fear. The same can
be accomplished with ducktape if necesary, but isn't recommended because it may prove very difficult to tape
someone while she is still actively resisting. Handcuffs click in place immediately and are easier to deploy
in a stressfull situation, making them the utility of choice for your restraining needs.

Another skill to understand, master, and practice is the ability to silence the prospective rapee.
For this, you may use a sock and duct tape or something similar to block their mouth. 
A gag would also suffice, but make sure you use tape over it or be sure the gag is big enough 
to avoid most of the screaming. However, this step can be skipped if you have the victim in a place of
your choosing you've prepared for just such an occasion. If that is the case, feel free to savor the
auditory bliss associated with the experience. Chains and handcuffs and the like make for poor bindings,
as they allow many degrees of freedom, but the psychological effects simply cannot be beat, and including 
heavy iron chians in your planning can pay off handsomely as they can truly terrify your target. Just make 
sure to avoid suspicision from pesky neighbors while installing the equipment in your basement. 
If they get suspicious, be especially nice to them. This can throw them off as some people will believe that 
"such a nice person wouldn't do that".  If funds allow, consider setting up a full-fledged 'dungeon'. This is 
preferable to enforce intercourse outside, as you have free reign over the victim once you've immobilized and
successfully transported her to your abode. Owning a plot of land in a remote location almost completely
eliminates many of the risks associated with nosy neighbors, wandering postmen, curious
children, and many other such nuisances that could jeopardize your maneuverings. The farther away you are from 
other people, the less likely you are to be found out.

Remember: preparation is half the battle!
