Knowing your terrain is everything for a successful coitus, reading up on
citymaps and or trying to learn the enviornment having a look on various closing times are crucial to a
good rape evasion. Have atleast two escape routes or more when you and your
partner is done with the coitus. Be sure your partner is in a safe location
where he/she can be found, but isn't reachable for random bypassesers for atleast
five minutes or more. Never have coitus outide of your living ground, if you cannot find a remote location
This is highly dangerous and could make your whole coitus all-for-nothing
as you can be recognized by people you may know or a bypasser can easily see.
Another option is having a temporary shelter for the night incase a search
party is set in motion, at that time moving on the streets by foot or car is
not the best idea. Be mindful if the neighborhood is socially close and work
together, or in the big city where people live more anonymously. You must also
have a hiding place, a safe location where you can store various memories and a dumping
place. Do not attempt to keep any evidence of your coitus happenings anywhere near your home.
Do not keep them in your house, someone can, and eventually will find it inside of yor home.
You will also need a place to destroy and clean your rapesuit and rapegear.

Note: Try to not reuse rapegear and rapesuit, unless it is aboslutely detirmental to do so.
